# Handover

## What is the current status of this project ?
For Oncollaboration, we worked with Quincy from CMD. We didn't have much time to complete the redesign, so we deliberately chose to create only the mobile version of the homepage. We implemented all the must-haves we had outlined for the homepages, with only a few minor bugs that we didn't get a chance to fixWat zijn de belangrijkste features die al werken?
The new homepage is still linked to the old pages so when choosing one of the following call to actions, Doctors, Contourings and Webinars. It will take you to the old pages that where made. when redesigning the other pages, you can apply its functionalities to the newly redesigned pages.

## What are the most important features that are currently working ?

**Old version functionalities** 
-	there are videos of the webinars available for the user to watch.
-	Video’s of the webinars have a timestamp feature
-	You can leave comments on the webinars video’s
-	You can filter when using the search feature

**New version functionalities**
-	Reusable call to actions (you can customize as desired)
-	Carousell that shows all the doctors

## What are the biggest concerns or challenges?

**Login**
-	Make a working login system for the user
-	Comments are hard coded so the next step would be to connect the comments to the users that are currently logged in.

## What's recommended as the first step for the next team?
